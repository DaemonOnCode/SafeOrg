### Why is it Important?

> Due to covid-19, the entire world has come to a halt. With over 49.8M cases worldwide and 1.25M deaths. Quarantine seems to be the only real solution. This dip in economic activity resulted in people losing their jobs. In many places, schools and offices have been completely shut-down to prevent covid form spreading.

### What the Statistics say

>In the first week of november schools Reopened in Andhra Pradesh, 500+ students & 800+ teachers tested positive for COVID-19 just in 3 days According to zee-news. As per The Economic Times, 17.7 million jobs were lost just in the month of April. By now over 50 million jobs have been lost, and thus we made a product to solve this problem.

## Let us help
